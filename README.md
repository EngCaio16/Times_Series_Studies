# **Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and SARIMAX**  

This repository contains two time series forecasting projects using **Statsmodels**, demonstrating the application of **ARIMA** and **SARIMAX (SARIMA)** models for real-world datasets.  

## **Projects Overview**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ ARIMA: World Population Forecasting**  
üìå **Dataset:** [World Population Growth](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maheshmani13/world-population-growth/data)  
üìà **Objective:** Forecast global population trends based on historical data.  
üîß **Approach:**  
- Used **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** to model and predict population growth.  
- Performed **stationarity tests (ADF test)** and **differencing** to stabilize the time series.  
- Tuned ARIMA hyperparameters **(p, d, q)** to optimize forecast accuracy.  
- Evaluated model performance with **residual diagnostics and AIC/BIC selection**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ SARIMAX: Forecasting Madrid‚Äôs Average Temperature**  
üìå **Dataset:** [Madrid Daily Weather](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahdiehhajian/madrid-daily-weather)  
üå° **Objective:** Predict Madrid‚Äôs average temperature using a seasonal time series model.  
üîß **Approach:**  
- Applied **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** to model seasonal temperature variations.  
- Conducted **seasonality analysis** and applied differencing to remove trends.  
- Optimized seasonal parameters **(P, D, Q, s)** using model selection criteria.  
- Included **confidence intervals** in the forecast to assess uncertainty.  
- Used **SARIMAX** to explore potential external regressors (if applicable).  

## **Tools & Libraries**  
‚úî **Python**  
‚úî **Statsmodels** (for time series modeling)  
‚úî **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)  
‚úî **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)  
‚úî **Plotly** (for interactive visualizations)  

## **Results & Insights**  
- ARIMA successfully modeled global population growth with minimal differencing.  
- SARIMAX effectively captured seasonal temperature variations in Madrid.  
- Both models highlight the importance of **stationarity, seasonal components, and hyperparameter tuning** in time series forecasting.
